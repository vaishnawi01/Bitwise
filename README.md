# Bitwise
Bitwise AND Operator &
The output of bitwise AND is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands is 1. If either bit of an operand is 0, the result of corresponding bit is evaluated to 0.
In C Programming, the bitwise AND operator is denoted by &.

Bitwise OR Operator |
The output of bitwise OR is 1 if at least one corresponding bit of two operands is 1. In C Programming, bitwise OR operator is denoted by |.

Bitwise XOR operator ^
The output of bitwise XOR operator is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands are opposite. It is denoted by ^.
